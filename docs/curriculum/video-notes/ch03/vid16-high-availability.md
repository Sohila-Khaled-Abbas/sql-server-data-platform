## 1. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, I should be able to explain the core idea behind **High Availability**, write/reproduce a small working example, and describe when the feature is useful in a real SQL Server data platform.

## 2. Core Architectural Concept

> [!info] Architectural Principle
> > > High availability is about service continuity. Separate HA from backup/restore and disaster recovery, then map architecture to RPO/RTO.

> [!tip] 2026 Data Engineering & DBRE Lens
> While watching, note which steps are product-specific UI actions versus durable SQL/database-engineering concepts. Your GitHub notes should preserve the latter.

## 3. SQL Implementation Pattern

```sql
-- HA checklist
-- RPO? RTO?
-- synchronous or asynchronous?
-- automatic or manual failover?
```

## 4. Production Engineering Evaluation Matrix

| Dimension | Critical Engineering Evaluation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Correctness** | What data invariant, operational behavior, or ACID guarantee does it enforce? |
| **Performance** | How does this affect I/O operations, page allocation, buffer cache, CPU, or lock contention? |
| **Operations** | How does this behave under disaster recovery, failover, backup chains, and migration? |
| **Maintainability** | Can another engineer easily diagnose, extend, or alter this object without breaking dependent callers? |

## 5. Hands-on Reproduction & Modification Drill

Rebuild the core pattern from memory in SSMS or Docker container. Test boundary conditions, edge cases, and failure modes.

```sql
-- Hands-on Verification & Edge Case Drill
-- HA checklist
-- RPO? RTO?
-- synchronous or asynchronous?
-- automatic or manual failover?
```

## 6. Definition of Done Checklist

> [!check] Validation Checklist
> - [ ] I can define the feature in one sentence.
> - [ ] I can explain why it exists.
> - [ ] I reproduced the basic example successfully.
> - [ ] I tested at least one edge case.
> - [ ] I can explain one performance/operational trade-off.
> - [ ] I linked the final script from my learning repo.

## 7. Mentor Checkpoint & Interview Drill

> [!question] Conceptual & Practical Challenge
> **Explain without SQL:** What problem would this feature solve in a production data platform, and what would you use instead when the feature is the wrong tool?

- **Important SSMS / Engine setting:**
- **Critical syntax nuance:**
- **Failure mode or trap avoided:**
- **Research item for deeper inquiry:**
